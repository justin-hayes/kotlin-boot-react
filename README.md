# Kotlin-Boot-React Demo
This project is intended to be a simple Hello World++ experiment in integrating a Kotlin and Spring Boot-based backend
with a React-based client-side application. Initial project layout is heavily inspired by the following resources and repositories:

- Geoffroy Warin's [blog](https://geowarin.github.io/spring-boot-and-react-hot.html) and [source](https://github.com/geowarin/boot-react)
